    <h2 id="EB">Early life and background</h2>
    <p> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822 to 1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.</p>
    <p>Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, he sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844 to 1891), who also came from Junagadh,and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (1860 to 1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862 to 1960); and another son, Karsandas (1866 to1913).</p>

    <p>Gandhi grew up in a Hindu and Jain religious atmosphere in his native Gujarat, which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau.At age 57 he declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious pluralism.</p>
    <p>Some of his best book is India of My Dreams: Dr. Rajendra Prasad in his  forward to this book observes, “The matchless weapon of truth and non-violence which Gandhi used is needed by the world to cure it of many of its ills.” The book, places before the reader not only the basic and fundamental principles of truth and nonviolence, but also indicates how we can help to fulfill them by establishing a polity and social life, through the instrumentality of a constitution and the dedication of the human material which this vast country has thrown upon us to work without any external fetters or internal inhibitions..</p>

    <h2 id="Legacy">Awards and honours</h2>
    <p>Time magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930. In the same magazine's 1999 list of The Most Important People of the Century, Gandhi was second only to Albert Einstein, who had called Gandhi "the greatest man of our age".The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D. in 1937.The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient. In 2011, Gandhi topped the TIME's list of top 25 political icons of all time.

        Gandhi did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee,though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947.Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award.Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that "there was no suitable living candidate" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi.Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, "The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question".When the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi".In the summer of 1995, the North American Vegetarian Society inducted him posthumously into the Vegetarian Hall of Fame..</p>
